# Astro-Adventure

### Overview

This is my first time making a game in Unity. I tried making a multiplayer game and testing out every type of game there is to make. Unfortunately I could only upload my simple game because it was one that I felt was simple enough.

I hoped that by learning how to make games through Unity it would teach me how to apply many Computer Science concepts. 
I not only learned so much but I now have a deep respect for those who make video games like Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild. It takes a lot to make games and it includes so many facets that I never considered.

I tested writing all sorts of games in both 3D and 2D. But this game, Astro Adevnture is a simple 2D game that explores 2 levels designed to get to an end flag that will help us progress. The controls are easy, left and right, and up arrow/space bar to jump. The goal of the game is to get as many coins and gems without dying to the moving enemies.

I hope in the future I may be able to make a working 2D multiplayer game that can be released on both the App Store and Play Store.
